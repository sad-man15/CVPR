# CVPR
The KNN code is designed to run the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It starts by loading the training images and their class labels into a list called TRAIN_DATA. The list is then shuffled randomly, and a sample of 50 images with their labels is displayed. The code then splits the shuffled data into 5 folds, using one fold for validation and the remaining 4 folds for training. Two distance metrics (L1 and L2) are used to calculate the distances between training and validation images. The algorithm's accuracy is calculated for different k values (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and the average accuracy across the 5 folds is recorded. The average accuracies for both L1 and L2 distances are plotted in the end.
